# It's interesting to see how different some of the listings are, e.g. that there actually seems to be a listing which can only be booked for a minimum of 1125 nights. Maybe those are apartments of people who are studying abroad for a few semester but don't want to give up their apartments in London or maybe it's just people which bought an apartment to rent out but don't want to commit to permanent renter.
# Those kind of questions are not interesting for me right now though. As mentioned, I want to visit London this year and we are staying for 4 nights only. We also have a budget we'd love to stick to. So I'll filter for all the listings that apply.

# before plotting the listings to a map, I would like to explore the data a little bit further with some other charts
# e.g. what are the cheaper and the more expensive neighbourhoods? And are apartments more expensive than private rooms? Are there more listings in certain parts of London? Keep in mind that I filtered the really expensive airbnbs out because they aren't in our budget. 

# let's first check that the data is clean enough for our analysis. I don't think we'll find too many mistakes because e.g. the neighbourhoods is probably a dropdown menu in airbnb and gets corrected by them. I don't think we'll find neighbourhoods with spelling mistakes.
